In order to make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85 we need to edit 
the hosts file from etc directory. Since we do not have permissions to do that, it is
impossible to modify the file.
We would have to open the file with the command 

sudo emacs /etc/hosts,
(vim or other text editors could be also used in order to open the hosts file)
change the IP address for intra.42.fr, and save the changes.
