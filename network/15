In order to make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85 we need to add  the address (intra. 42.fr) and 
the IP (46.19.122.85) to the hosts file from etc directory. Since we do not have permissions to do that, it is
impossible to modify the file.

We would have to open the file with the command 
sudo emacs /etc/hosts,
(vim or other text editors could be also used in order to open the hosts file)
add the address and the IP and save the changes.
